# 🍔 Cloud-Native Food Ordering & Delivery System

**Cloud-Native Food Ordering & Delivery System** is a robust, scalable application built using a **Microservice Architecture** designed to streamline the end-to-end food ordering process. This system enables **restaurants**, **customers**, and **delivery agents** to interact seamlessly through independently deployable services.

Built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and fully **Dockerized** for cloud-native deployments, each microservice (e.g., Authentication, Menu, Orders, Payments, Notifications, Delivery) functions independently, allowing for high **fault tolerance** and **easy maintenance**.

### 🚀 Key Features
- Modular microservices architecture
- Dynamic menu and restaurant management
- Real-time order status and tracking
- Multiple payment gateway integration
- User role management (Admin, Customer, Restaurant, Rider)
- API Gateway with service discovery
- Docker & container orchestration support

This repository offers a modern, production-ready foundation to build full-featured cloud-native food delivery systems with speed, efficiency, and flexibility in mind.
